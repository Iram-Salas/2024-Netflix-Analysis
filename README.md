# 2024-Netflix-Analysis

This is my personal view history for Netflix up until December 2023. It is just for fun.
My family shares my Netflix account so not all of it is my view history.

If you'd like to also download and analyze you Netflix data you can request it from you Netflix account settings.
Just go to 'Account' -> 'Profile & Parental Controls' -> 'Viewing Activity' -> Scroll to bottom and select 'Download All'.
It can take up to 30 days for them to email you the files depending on how much data it is.

The only file that really matters in the files they send is the viewing activity csv.
